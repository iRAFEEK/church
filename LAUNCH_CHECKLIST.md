> Created: 2026-06-22 · Grounded in a direct codebase audit (not just the State-of-the-Product report).
> Verified counts: 74 migrations · 146 API routes · 113 pages · 113 loading states · 2,558 EN keys.

**Legend:** Effort — S (<½ day) · M (½–2 days) · L (2–5 days) · XL (>1 week)

## P0 — Launch Blockers (do before ANY real church touches the app)

These are correctness/safety gates. A real church onboarded before these is a real risk.

- [ ] **Apply all migrations 001→072 to the production Supabase project and verify.** Diff prod schema vs `supabase/migrations/`. Confirm RLS is enabled on every table. — `L` — _the docs/CLAUDE.md only track through 055; prod is the unknown._
- [ ] **Independent security / RLS review before onboarding.** 9 of 74 migrations are "fix" migrations, several closing RLS gaps (push tokens, notifications were briefly too open). Gaps are closed, but the reactive pattern warrants one defensive pass. Focus: cross-church isolation, the newer tables (meetings, action items, bookings, liturgy, shared songs, outreach assignments). — `L`
- [ ] **Rotate ALL keys for production** (Supabase service role, Firebase admin private key, Resend, WhatsApp, PostHog, CRON_SECRET). Treat any key that has lived in a working folder / laptop as compromised-by-default. — `S`
- [ ] **Verify multi-church isolation with real concurrent data.** Two churches, overlapping users, confirm zero cross-tenant leakage in: members, finance, prayers, notifications, community needs, songs (incl. the new scoped/global song sharing). — `M`
- [ ] **Gate every backend-only feature behind a feature flag** so half-built UIs can't surface in production. Affected: ministry meetings, action items/tasks, outreach assignments, prayer responses. (`church_features` system already exists.) — `S`
- [ ] **Confirm `CRON_SECRET` is set in prod and cron auth is enforced** on `/api/cron/*` (event reminders, visitor SLA, notification retention). — `S`

---

## P1 — Launch-Critical (do before opening the doors)

- [ ] **Move rate limiting to a shared store (Upstash/Redis).** Current limiter is in-memory (`lib/api/rate-limit.ts` — the code comment already says so). On Vercel's many short-lived instances it's far weaker than it looks. — `M`
- [ ] **Real-device testing matrix:** budget Android + iOS, Arabic (RTL) mode, offline/airplane (PWA fallback), PWA install flow, push notifications end-to-end (FCM). Document results. — `M`
- [ ] **Ship real brand PWA icons** (192px, 512px, maskable) — currently placeholders in `public/icons`. — `S`
- [ ] **Run a Lighthouse baseline on the production URL** for `/dashboard`, `/admin/finance`, `/events`, `/bible`. Record scores in CLAUDE.md §9 (only 3 routes measured today). — `S`
- [ ] **Finish Egyptian-Arabic translations: 332 missing keys** (`messages/ar-eg.json` has 2,226 of 2,558). Users currently get fallback text. Also close the 12-key `ar` gap. — `M`
- [ ] **Add end-to-end tests for the critical paths:** sign-up → onboarding, record donation → see it in my-giving, permission enforcement (member cannot reach admin/finance), visitor intake → pipeline. No e2e tests exist today. — `L`
- [ ] **Wire up Sentry + verify alerts fire** in production (errors, source maps, release tracking). Confirm conditional import doesn't suppress prod errors. — `S`
- [ ] **Verify PostHog in prod** (EU residency, no PII in events, identify on login). Spot-check 5 key events actually land. — `S`
- [ ] **Health check + uptime monitor** pointed at `/api/health`. — `S`
- [ ] **Set up DB backups / point-in-time recovery** on the production Supabase project and test a restore. — `M`
- [ ] **Confirm `npm run build` is green and `npx tsc --noEmit` is 0 errors** in CI (report couldn't verify these in its sandbox). Add to a pre-deploy gate. — `S`

---

## P2 — Pilot Phase (1–3 friendly churches, behind flags)

- [ ] **Onboard 1–3 known churches**, watch Sentry + PostHog daily for the first 2 weeks. — `M`
- [ ] **Tighten the rough edges real users expose** in the highest-traffic flows: visitor intake form, finance data entry, notifications delivery. — `M`
- [ ] **Load-sanity the finance module** with a real chart of accounts + a month of donations; confirm reports and double-entry balances hold. — `M`
- [ ] **Collect a feedback channel** (in-app or WhatsApp) and triage weekly. — `S`
- [ ] **Write a 1-page onboarding runbook** for a new church (create church → import members → set roles → first event). — `S`

---

## P3 — Fast-Follow (quick wins — backend already done, just needs UI)

The data model + API exist; these are UI-only builds. High value, low risk.

- [ ] **Ministry meetings UI** — schedule, notes, action items. API: `app/api/ministries/[id]/meetings`, migration 059. — `M`
- [ ] **Action items / tasks UI** — standalone + meeting-linked, assignable to members. API: `app/api/ministries/[id]/action-items` + migration 063. — `M`
- [ ] **Outreach assignments UI** — assign members to outreach leaders for accountability. API: `app/api/outreach/assignments`, migration 060. — `M`
- [ ] **Prayer responses UI** — richer response/update tracking on prayers. Migration 061. — `M`
- [ ] Add nav entries + permission flags + `loading.tsx` + i18n for each of the above (per project standards). — `S each`

---

## P4 — Code Quality & Tech-Debt Cleanup (non-blocking, do alongside)

- [ ] **Sync CLAUDE.md + `types/database.ts` with reality.** Docs stop at 55 migrations / March 15; codebase is at 74 with whole features (shared song library, Coptic liturgy, locations/bookings, meetings) undocumented. Replace manual DB types with `supabase gen types`. — `M`
- [ ] **Reduce loose `any` types: 83 today** (docs claimed ~11). Not alarming, but trending up. — `M`
- [ ] **Replace 31 raw `console.*` calls** in `app/`/`lib/` with the structured logger. — `S`
- [ ] **Narrow the 2 remaining `select('*')`** in API routes. — `S`
- [ ] **Add CI workflow** running `vitest`, `tsc --noEmit`, build, and the RTL grep check on every PR. — `M`

---

## P5 — Monetization & Scale (post-launch, plan deliberately)

- [ ] **Online giving via Stripe** — only a flag exists today (`finance/settings`). Likely the biggest adoption/monetization driver; design it properly, not as an afterthought. — `XL`
- [ ] **Donation receipts (PDF)** and **bank reconciliation** — tables/flags exist, UI/logic don't. — `L`
- [ ] **Native app-store distribution** via the started Capacitor wrapper (Android first, then iOS) with FCM. — `XL`
- [ ] **Recurring donations**, email campaigns, small-group curriculum — growth features. — `XL`

## Risk Register (CEO-level, from the audit)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation (mapped to items above) |
|---|---|---|
| Reactive security history (RLS gaps fixed late) | Medium | P0 security review + P0 isolation test |
| In-memory rate limiting won't scale on serverless | Medium | P1 move to Upstash/Redis |
| Live keys sit in working folder | Medium | P0 rotate all keys + encrypt laptops/backups |
| No e2e tests | Low–Med | P1 e2e for sign-up / giving / permissions |
| Doc drift / single-founder bus factor | Medium | P4 sync CLAUDE.md, keep current |
| Unfinished features could surface half-built | Low | P0 feature-flag gating |
| No payment processing yet | Low | P5 Stripe, planned deliberately |

**Reassuring context:** no evidence of cross-church data leakage, no secrets in git, no architectural dead-ends. This is a normal pre-launch hardening list for a serious product — the gap to launch is operational, not foundational.
